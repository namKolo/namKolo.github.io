      <description>In the part 1, I wrote about how to set up simple editor with draft-js. But it was not the end, I had to do more. My side project needed the editor with below features:
 Change text color Change font size / font family Support drag and drop images Emoji/Hashtag  Hmmm, I searched lots about those features on google. Lots of good library built on top draft-js supported them.</description>

      <description>One week ago, I had to implement Rich Text editor as one of features in my side project. After searching, I found draft-js which supported react very well. It looked so cool. So I decided to integrate it with my project. During that integration and studying, I struggled lots - from setting a simple editor to adding more advanced features for it. It was a really amazing journey to acknowledge myself.</description>

      <description>I always wonder how to setup webpack to build a frontend react app from scratch? At the first glance, I felt so terrible about its document. It looks so big !!! Lots of things to do. But anything can be learned by step by step method. So I divided that progress into sub steps that I can follow.
First step is really simple. Just compile and copy code in src to public/build.</description>
