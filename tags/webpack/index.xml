      <description>I always wonder how to setup webpack to build a frontend react app from scratch? At the first glance, I felt so terrible about its document. It looks so big !!! Lots of things to do. But anything can be learned by step by step method. So I divided that progress into sub steps that I can follow.
First step is really simple. Just compile and copy code in src to public/build.</description>
